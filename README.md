# README

This repository contains the code used to create the stimuli, as well as run the analyses presented in:

Yeaton, J.D.; Tosatto, L.; Fagot, J.; Grainger, J.; Rey, A. _Simple questions on simple associations: Regularity extraction in non-human primates._

This code as well as the raw stimuli and data from the study are available in the corresponding [OSF repository](https://osf.io/q9z2m/).

Each folder of this repository (and the OSF one) contains a README file explaining its contents. If I've left anything out, or you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the first author at jyeaton@uci.edu.
